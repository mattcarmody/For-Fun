# For-Fun
Projects that don't exactly have a practical value for me, but that I wanted to build. I have a thing for information hidden in plain sight...

# interstateInfo
In this educational script, a user enters an interstate number and receives information about that interstate. All the information is derived solely from the number, based on the naming conventions of the Interstate Highway System.

# isbnCheck
This script uses the check digit built into an ISBN to check whether a user inputted ISBN is potentially valid. It's compatible with both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13. If the user inputs the first 9 or 12 digits of an ISBN, the final check digit is provided.
